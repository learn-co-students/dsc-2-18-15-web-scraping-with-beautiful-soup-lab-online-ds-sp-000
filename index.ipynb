Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread. Taking no chances, you come with me. I'll split you to the bone, help set you free.  Twenty-seven, everyone was nice. Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price. See their bodies out on the ice. Take my time.  Am I evil? Yes I am. Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.  On with the action now, I'll strip your pride. I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride. Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat. Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet.  Am I evil? Yes I am. Am I evil? I am man.  I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire. You can come with me, sweet desire. My face is long forgot, my face not my own. Sweet and timely whore, take me home.  Am I evil? Yes I am. Am I evil? I am man.  My soul is longing for, await my heir. Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself. My face is long forgot, my face not my own. Sweet and timely whore, take me home.  Am I evil? Yes I am. Am I evil? I am man.  Am I evil? Yes I fucking am. Am I evil? I am man, yeah. Let us have peace, let us have life, Let us escape the cruel night. Let us have time, let the sun shine, Let us beware the deadly sign.  The day is coming, Armageddon's near, Inferno's coming, can we survive the blitzkrieg. The blitzkrieg, the blitzkrieg.  Save us from fate, save us from hate, Save ourselves before it's too late. Come to our need, hear our plea, Save ourselves before the earth bleeds.  The day is dawning, the time is near, Aliens calling, can we survive the blitzkrieg.\",\n",
